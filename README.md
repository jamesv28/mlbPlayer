#James Volmert's front-end personal project 

##User and Users

My personal project is a kind of "competition" web app that compares baseball players
as well as the baseball team itself. The project will first look at an indiviual player
and the user will be able to add an additional player to look at their stats.

Somewhere on the page there will be a compete button which will start an animation 
series on a modal which will compare and find the player with the better stats.

I also would like to do the same thing with the teams themselves, comparing
historical win/loss records.

Pitchers are going to be a different breed all together and will have to be 
treated differently with regards to their stats.

###Things I would like to retrieve
* How much the franchises spend
* See how this affected the team

##Technologies Needed

I will be utilizing bootstrap as a quick front-end framework.  I 
will also be trying to use PostCSS to pre-compile my stylesheets.  jQuery
will be used for animating and activating sound bites.

### Outside of the main scope - added features
* I would like to use the youTube api to load up the most popular
* d3.js or related library to chart the statistics and run it against league averages or maybe even the positions they play
* twitter api to look at the top five tweets of the person

##Key stats being looked at

* Batting Avg.
* years in the MLB
* wins above replacement 

###Pivotal Tracker
Pivotal Tracker will be crucial for managing which features I would like to add and also manage my time.
