#James Volmert's front-end personal project 

##User and Users

My personal project is a kind of "competition" web app that compares baseball players
as well as the baseball team itself. The project will first look at an indiviual player
and the user will be able to add an additional player to look at their stats.

Somewhere on the page there will be a compete button which will start an animation 
series on a modal which will compare and find the player with the better stats.

##Technologies Needed

I will be utilizing bootstrap as a quick front-end framework.  I 
will also be trying to use PostCSS to pre-compile my stylesheets.  jQuery
will be used for animating and activating sound bites.

###Key stats being looked at

* Batting Avg.
* years in the MLB
* wins above replacement
