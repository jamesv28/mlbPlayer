#James Volmert's front-end personal project 

##User and Users

My personal project is a kind of "competition" web app that compares baseball players
as well as the baseball team itself. The project will first look at an indiviual player
and the user will be able to add an additional player to look at their stats.

Somewhere on the page there will be a compete button which will start an animation 
series on a modal which will compare and find the player with the better stats.

##Technologies Needed

I am going to use bootstrap as as my webkit. I will attempt to use PostCSS.
I will be using an api to get all player's historical data
jQuery will be used to trigger sounds and animation
Pivotal Tracker will be used to manage features

###Key stats being looked at

1. Batting Avg.
2 years in the MLB
3 wins above replacement
