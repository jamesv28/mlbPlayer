For my personal project I want to get hisotrical data from an 
api that shows an MLB player's statistics. 

With the statistics, I also want to compare them with the league's
average and other specifications.

I want to include a compete function which also takes in another
baseball players stats and they "compete" to see which one is the 
better player overall.
